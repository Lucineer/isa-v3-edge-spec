# CLAUDE.md — isa-v3-edge-spec

ISA v3 edge encoding: variable-width 1-3 byte instructions for bare-metal agents.

## What This Crate Is
A library in the Lucineer fleet. Part of the broader FLUX/plato ecosystem.

## Boarding
1. Read this file (CLAUDE.md)
2. Check README.md for usage and API
3. Check git log for recent changes
4. Run tests before modifying: `cargo test` (Rust) or `go test` (Go) or `make` (C)


## Shell-First Protocol (Fleet-Wide Mandate — 2026-04-23)

The agent is TRANSIENT. The shell is PERMANENT. The agent operates the shell. The shell IS the continuity.

1. **Store before act.** No prompt is acted upon until it is written to a file.
2. **Orders are sacred.** Write every directive to a file before acknowledging.
3. **Annotate as you go.** Check off items as complete. Add notes.
4. **Push after every step.** Git commit + push = backup. If the machine dies, clone and continue.
5. **Context loss is trivial.** Reading the shell recovers 100% of orders and progress.

If you don't understand the state after reading these files, ask Casey. Do not guess.
